This past semester I worked as a Data Engineer for [Address Income](https://www.addressincome.com/company/about-us) - a real estate investment firm. During this time I was able to complete wide range of cool projects that brought me out of my comfort zone as an information systems major. 

# Background 
One of the goals Address Income has is to host an online platform that congregates key real estate data into a pleasant user interface everyday investors are able to access. The website will also contain features such as but not limited to: Single family and multi family analytics reports, varying levels of access for different user types, dashboards, and realtime data updates.

# Projects
This resulted in a variety of projects that I had the pleasure of working on. In this blog, I will focus on the top three: **Data cleaning using Airflow pipelines and python pandas library**, **Setting up Deployment of a Development website through Github Actions**, and **Configuring a Docker compose file for user authentication**.
